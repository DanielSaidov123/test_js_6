I created 8 classes so the reason
I created the flight which is the Flight class
And there are methods for creating tickets depending on which ticket is VIP or regular

Then I created a Passenger class which inherits the Student and RegularPassenger classes

In these two classes I did the calculation in the methods and sent it as an array of the amount purchased and the name of the buyer and then outside I send the array to the Flight class where I create the tickets according to what he chose

And I have another Ticket class that inherits from VIPTicket and RegularTicket
Although I didn't have to have RegularTicket but to be clearer

And I also made an Airport class where I created a method that creates tickets for me until there is no space and it makes me 90% regular 10% VIP

I added a main of just tests as they wanted.

I also did the tests as you requested.
